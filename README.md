### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ankita and I'm a sophomore pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science & Engineering with a specialization in Cloud Computing. 
I am very passionate about Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Data Science in addition to a leisurely and cursory interest in Business and Management. I am actively pursuing several courses on online resources and projects in order to develop my skills. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like Python and Node.js. I also enjoy ui, ux, and design in general.
